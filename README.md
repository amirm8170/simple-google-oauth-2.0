This is funny simple secure web application to login with google account and check /secret route after login. 
I've used cookie to serialize and deserialize user in cookie to let user to login without enter password for 24 hours, but if 24 hours left client should re-enter password and login again to check secret route.
it's funnny project in my holidays.<br>
that's it.<br>
I've used passportjs and google oauth2.0 strategy and cookie-session package to build it.<br>
Happy new year.
